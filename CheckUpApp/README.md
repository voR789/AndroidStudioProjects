## H2 CheckUp
*CheckUp is a WIP app (around 75% to production), based on the Andriod Jetpack Compose architecture, coded in Kotlin*
CheckUp is an app that allows users to put in medical information that doctors would usually monitor during a check up, hence the name. Daily monitoring along with user data allows any medical discrepencies to be tracked and analyzed.

TODO
- Implement graphs
- Implement database system already done in "Heart Rate" to other trackables
